You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 5 x 5. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4
0 S . . . .
1 . . . F .
2 F . G . .
3 M M M X .
4 . . . . .

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN↓(1,0), LEFT←(0,0)
From (0,1): UP↑(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN↓(1,1), LEFT←(0,0)
From (1,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN↓(2,0), LEFT←(1,0)

TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(3, 3)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(2, 0), (1, 3)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(3, 0), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (2, 2) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 25 states in the 5x5 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.
