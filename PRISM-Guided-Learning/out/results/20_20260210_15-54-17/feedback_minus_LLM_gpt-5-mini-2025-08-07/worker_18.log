You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 10 x 10. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 S X . . . . . . . .
1 . . . . X . . . X .
2 . . X . . . X . . .
3 . . . X . X X . . X
4 X . X . . . . X . G
5 F . X . X . X X . .
6 . . . . M M M M X .
7 . . . . . X . X . .
8 . . . . . F . . . X
9 . . . X . X . . . X

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN↓(1,0), LEFT←(0,0)
From (0,1): UP↑(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN↓(1,1), LEFT←(0,0)
From (1,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN↓(2,0), LEFT←(1,0)

TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(1, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 8), (8, 9), (7, 7), (3, 5), (5, 7), (3, 6), (7, 5), (5, 6), (9, 5), (3, 9), (9, 9), (4, 0), (1, 8), (4, 2), (5, 4), (0, 1), (9, 3), (2, 6)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(5, 0), (8, 5)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (4, 9) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 100 states in the 10x10 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN↓(1,0), LEFT←(0,0)
From (0,1): UP↑(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN↓(1,1), LEFT←(0,0)
From (1,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN↓(2,0), LEFT←(1,0)

TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(1, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 8), (8, 9), (7, 7), (3, 5), (5, 7), (3, 6), (7, 5), (5, 6), (9, 5), (3, 9), (9, 9), (4, 0), (1, 8), (4, 2), (5, 4), (0, 1), (9, 3), (2, 6)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(8, 5)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (5, 0) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 100 states in the 10x10 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 10 x 10. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 S X . . . . . . . .
1 . . . . X . . . X .
2 . . X . . . X . . .
3 . . . X . X X . . X
4 X . X . . . . X . .
5 . . X . X . X X . .
6 . . . . M M M M X .
7 . . . . . X . X . .
8 . . . . . G . . . X
9 . . . X . X . . . X

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN↓(1,0), LEFT←(0,0)
From (0,1): UP↑(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN↓(1,1), LEFT←(0,0)
From (1,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN↓(2,0), LEFT←(1,0)

TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(1, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 8), (8, 9), (7, 7), (3, 5), (5, 7), (3, 6), (7, 5), (5, 6), (9, 5), (3, 9), (9, 9), (4, 0), (1, 8), (4, 2), (5, 4), (0, 1), (9, 3), (2, 6)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (8, 5) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 100 states in the 10x10 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 10 x 10. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 S X . . . . . . . .
1 . . . . X . . . X .
2 . . X . . . X . . .
3 . . . X . X X . . X
4 X . X . . . . X . G
5 F . X . X . X X . .
6 . . . . M M M M X .
7 . . . . . X . X . .
8 . . . . . F . . . X
9 . . . X . X . . . X

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN↓(1,0), LEFT←(0,0)
From (0,1): UP↑(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN↓(1,1), LEFT←(0,0)
From (1,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN↓(2,0), LEFT←(1,0)

TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(1, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 8), (8, 9), (7, 7), (3, 5), (5, 7), (3, 6), (7, 5), (5, 6), (9, 5), (3, 9), (9, 9), (4, 0), (1, 8), (4, 2), (5, 4), (0, 1), (9, 3), (2, 6)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(5, 0), (8, 5)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (4, 9) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

A previous policy generated for this problem has the following probabilities for the requirements:

  goal1: 0.8723 (threshold: 0.8)  -- meets threshold  [relevant to this goal]
  goal2: 0.0587 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.7413 below threshold
  goal3: 0.2904 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.5096 below threshold
  seq_1_before_2: 0.8136 (threshold: 0.8)  -- meets threshold  [relevant to this goal]
  seq_2_before_3: 0.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.8000 below threshold  [relevant to this goal]
  complete_sequence: 0.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.8000 below threshold
  avoid_moving_seg1: 0.9889 (threshold: 0.5)  -- meets threshold  [relevant to this goal]
  avoid_moving_seg2: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.5)  -- meets threshold

The following is a visualization of the previous policy:
   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0  ↓ X↓  →  →  →  →  →  →  →  ↓
1  →  →  →  ↓ X←  →  →  ↓ X←  ↓
2  →  ↓ X←  →  →  ↑ X←  →  →  ↑
3  →  →  ← X←  ↓ X← X→  →  ↓ X←
4 X→  ↓ X→  →  →  →  ← X←  →  G
5 F→  ↓ X←  ↓ X←  ↑ X← X→  →  ↑
6  →  →  →  ↓ M← M↑ M↓ M← X→  ↑
7  →  →  →  →  ↓ X←  ↓ X←  →  ↑
8  →  →  →  →  ↓ F→  →  →  ↑ X←
9  →  →  ↑ X←  ↑ X←  →  →  ↑ X←

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- M→ = Moving obstacle with action (e.g., M→ means moving obstacle, action is RIGHT)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)
- G = Current goal (destination)


Compare this policy to the grid layout above to identify where actions lead toward obstacles or away from the goal.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 100 states in the 10x10 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 10 x 10. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 S X . . . . . . . .
1 . . . . X . . . X .
2 . . X . . . X . . .
3 . . . X . X X . . X
4 X . X . . . . X . .
5 G . X . X . X X . .
6 . . . . M M M M X .
7 . . . . . X . X . .
8 . . . . . F . . . X
9 . . . X . X . . . X

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN↓(1,0), LEFT←(0,0)
From (0,1): UP↑(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN↓(1,1), LEFT←(0,0)
From (1,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN↓(2,0), LEFT←(1,0)

TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(1, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 8), (8, 9), (7, 7), (3, 5), (5, 7), (3, 6), (7, 5), (5, 6), (9, 5), (3, 9), (9, 9), (4, 0), (1, 8), (4, 2), (5, 4), (0, 1), (9, 3), (2, 6)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(8, 5)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (5, 0) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

A previous policy generated for this problem has the following probabilities for the requirements:

  goal1: 0.8723 (threshold: 0.8)  -- meets threshold
  goal2: 0.0587 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.7413 below threshold  [relevant to this goal]
  goal3: 0.2904 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.5096 below threshold
  seq_1_before_2: 0.8136 (threshold: 0.8)  -- meets threshold
  seq_2_before_3: 0.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.8000 below threshold  [relevant to this goal]
  complete_sequence: 0.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.8000 below threshold
  avoid_moving_seg1: 0.9889 (threshold: 0.5)  -- meets threshold
  avoid_moving_seg2: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.5)  -- meets threshold  [relevant to this goal]
  avoid_moving_seg3: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.5)  -- meets threshold

The following is a visualization of the previous policy:
   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0  ↓ X←  ↓  ←  ←  ←  ←  ←  ←  ←
1  ↓  ←  ←  ← X←  ↓  ←  ← X←  ↓
2  ↓  ← X←  ↑  ←  ← X←  ↓  ←  ←
3  ↓  ←  ← X←  ↓ X← X↓  ↑  ← X←
4 X↓  ↓ X←  ↓  ←  ←  ← X←  ↓  ←
5  G  ← X←  ↑ X←  ↑ X← X→  →  ←
6  ↑  ←  ←  ← M← M↑ M↓ M← X↑  ↑
7  ↑  ←  ←  ←  ← X←  ↓ X←  ↓  ←
8  ↑  ←  ←  ←  ← F←  ↑  ←  ← X←
9  ↑  ←  ← X←  ↑ X←  ↑  ←  ← X←

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- M→ = Moving obstacle with action (e.g., M→ means moving obstacle, action is RIGHT)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)
- G = Current goal (destination)


Compare this policy to the grid layout above to identify where actions lead toward obstacles or away from the goal.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 100 states in the 10x10 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 10 x 10. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 S X . . . . . . . .
1 . . . . X . . . X .
2 . . X . . . X . . .
3 . . . X . X X . . X
4 X . X . . . . X . .
5 . . X . X . X X . .
6 . . . . M M M M X .
7 . . . . . X . X . .
8 . . . . . G . . . X
9 . . . X . X . . . X

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN↓(1,0), LEFT←(0,0)
From (0,1): UP↑(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN↓(1,1), LEFT←(0,0)
From (1,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN↓(2,0), LEFT←(1,0)

TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(1, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 8), (8, 9), (7, 7), (3, 5), (5, 7), (3, 6), (7, 5), (5, 6), (9, 5), (3, 9), (9, 9), (4, 0), (1, 8), (4, 2), (5, 4), (0, 1), (9, 3), (2, 6)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (8, 5) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

A previous policy generated for this problem has the following probabilities for the requirements:

  goal1: 0.8723 (threshold: 0.8)  -- meets threshold
  goal2: 0.0587 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.7413 below threshold
  goal3: 0.2904 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.5096 below threshold  [relevant to this goal]
  seq_1_before_2: 0.8136 (threshold: 0.8)  -- meets threshold
  seq_2_before_3: 0.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.8000 below threshold
  complete_sequence: 0.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.8000 below threshold
  avoid_moving_seg1: 0.9889 (threshold: 0.5)  -- meets threshold
  avoid_moving_seg2: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.5)  -- meets threshold
  avoid_moving_seg3: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.5)  -- meets threshold  [relevant to this goal]

The following is a visualization of the previous policy:
   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0  ↓ X→  →  →  →  ↓  ←  ←  ←  ←
1  →  →  →  ↓ X→  ↓  ←  ← X←  ↓
2  →  ↓ X→  →  →  ↑ X←  ↓  ←  ←
3  →  →  ← X→  ↓ X↓ X↓  ↑  ← X←
4 X→  ↓ X→  →  →  ↓  ← X←  ↓  ←
5  →  ↓ X→  ↓ X→  ↑ X← X→  ↑  ←
6  →  →  →  ↓ M↓ M↑ M↓ M← X↓  ↓
7  →  →  →  →  ↓ X↓  ↓ X←  ↓  ←
8  →  →  →  →  →  G  ←  ←  ← X←
9  →  →  ↑ X→  ↑ X↑  ↑  ←  ← X←

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- M→ = Moving obstacle with action (e.g., M→ means moving obstacle, action is RIGHT)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)
- G = Current goal (destination)


Compare this policy to the grid layout above to identify where actions lead toward obstacles or away from the goal.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 100 states in the 10x10 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 10 x 10. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 S X . . . . . . . .
1 . . . . X . . . X .
2 . . X . . . X . . .
3 . . . X . X X . . X
4 X . X . . . . X . G
5 F . X . X . X X . .
6 . . . . M M M M X .
7 . . . . . X . X . .
8 . . . . . F . . . X
9 . . . X . X . . . X

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN↓(1,0), LEFT←(0,0)
From (0,1): UP↑(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN↓(1,1), LEFT←(0,0)
From (1,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN↓(2,0), LEFT←(1,0)

TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(1, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 8), (8, 9), (7, 7), (3, 5), (5, 7), (3, 6), (7, 5), (5, 6), (9, 5), (3, 9), (9, 9), (4, 0), (1, 8), (4, 2), (5, 4), (0, 1), (9, 3), (2, 6)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(5, 0), (8, 5)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (4, 9) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

A previous policy generated for this problem has the following probabilities for the requirements:

  seq_2_before_3: 0.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.8000 below threshold  [relevant to this goal]
  complete_sequence: 0.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.8000 below threshold

The following is a visualization of the previous policy:

8  →  →  →  →  ↓ F→  →  →  ↑ X←
9  →  →  ↑ X←  ↑ X←  →  →  ↑ X←

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- M→ = Moving obstacle with action (e.g., M→ means moving obstacle, action is RIGHT)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)
- G = Current goal (destination)


Compare this policy to the grid layout above to identify where actions lead toward obstacles or away from the goal.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 100 states in the 10x10 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 10 x 10. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 S X . . . . . . . .
1 . . . . X . . . X .
2 . . X . . . X . . .
3 . . . X . X X . . X
4 X . X . . . . X . .
5 G . X . X . X X . .
6 . . . . M M M M X .
7 . . . . . X . X . .
8 . . . . . F . . . X
9 . . . X . X . . . X

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN↓(1,0), LEFT←(0,0)
From (0,1): UP↑(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN↓(1,1), LEFT←(0,0)
From (1,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN↓(2,0), LEFT←(1,0)

TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(1, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 8), (8, 9), (7, 7), (3, 5), (5, 7), (3, 6), (7, 5), (5, 6), (9, 5), (3, 9), (9, 9), (4, 0), (1, 8), (4, 2), (5, 4), (0, 1), (9, 3), (2, 6)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(8, 5)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (5, 0) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

The following is a visualization of the previous policy:

8  ↑  ←  ←  ←  ← F←  ↑  ←  ← X←
9  ↑  ←  ← X←  ↑ X←  ↑  ←  ← X←

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- M→ = Moving obstacle with action (e.g., M→ means moving obstacle, action is RIGHT)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)
- G = Current goal (destination)


Compare this policy to the grid layout above to identify where actions lead toward obstacles or away from the goal.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 100 states in the 10x10 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 10 x 10. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
0 S X . . . . . . . .
1 . . . . X . . . X .
2 . . X . . . X . . .
3 . . . X . X X . . X
4 X . X . . . . X . .
5 . . X . X . X X . .
6 . . . . M M M M X .
7 . . . . . X . X . .
8 . . . . . G . . . X
9 . . . X . X . . . X

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN↓(1,0), LEFT←(0,0)
From (0,1): UP↑(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN↓(1,1), LEFT←(0,0)
From (1,0): UP↑(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN↓(2,0), LEFT←(1,0)

TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(1, 4), (3, 3), (2, 2), (4, 7), (5, 2), (6, 8), (8, 9), (7, 7), (3, 5), (5, 7), (3, 6), (7, 5), (5, 6), (9, 5), (3, 9), (9, 9), (4, 0), (1, 8), (4, 2), (5, 4), (0, 1), (9, 3), (2, 6)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(6, 4), (6, 5), (6, 6), (6, 7), (6, 6), (6, 5)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (8, 5) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

A previous policy generated for this problem has the following probabilities for the requirements:

  goal1: 0.8723 (threshold: 0.8)  -- meets threshold
  goal2: 0.0587 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.7413 below threshold

  seq_1_before_2: 0.8136 (threshold: 0.8)  -- meets threshold
  seq_2_before_3: 0.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.8000 below threshold
  complete_sequence: 0.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  -- 0.8000 below threshold
  avoid_moving_seg1: 0.9889 (threshold: 0.5)  -- meets threshold

The following is a visualization of the previous policy:
   0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9
0  ↓ X→  →  →  →  ↓  ←  ←  ←  ←
1  →  →  →  ↓ X→  ↓  ←  ← X←  ↓
2  →  ↓ X→  →  →  ↑ X←  ↓  ←  ←
3  →  →  ← X→  ↓ X↓ X↓  ↑  ← X←
4 X→  ↓ X→  →  →  ↓  ← X←  ↓  ←
5  →  ↓ X→  ↓ X→  ↑ X← X→  ↑  ←
6  →  →  →  ↓ M↓ M↑ M↓ M← X↓  ↓
7  →  →  →  →  ↓ X↓  ↓ X←  ↓  ←
8  →  →  →  →  →  G  ←  ←  ← X←
9  →  →  ↑ X→  ↑ X↑  ↑  ←  ← X←

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- M→ = Moving obstacle with action (e.g., M→ means moving obstacle, action is RIGHT)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)
- G = Current goal (destination)


Compare this policy to the grid layout above to identify where actions lead toward obstacles or away from the goal.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 100 states in the 10x10 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.
