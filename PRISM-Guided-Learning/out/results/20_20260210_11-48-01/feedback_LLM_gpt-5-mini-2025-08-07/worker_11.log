You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 6 x 6. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 S . . . G .
1 . F . . . .
2 X . . M M .
3 . X . . . .
4 . X F . . .
5 . . X . . .

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through


COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column

ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN→(1,0), LEFT→(0,0)
From (0,1): UP→(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN→(1,1), LEFT→(0,0)
From (1,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN→(2,0), LEFT→(1,0)


TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(1, 1), (4, 2)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(2, 4), (2, 3)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along the trajectory each timestep)
- Your current goal: (0, 4) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 36 states in the 6x6 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 6 x 6. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 S . . . . .
1 . G . . . .
2 X . . M M .
3 . X . . . .
4 . X F . . .
5 . . X . . .

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through


COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column

ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN→(1,0), LEFT→(0,0)
From (0,1): UP→(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN→(1,1), LEFT→(0,0)
From (1,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN→(2,0), LEFT→(1,0)


TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(4, 2)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(2, 4), (2, 3)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along the trajectory each timestep)
- Your current goal: (1, 1) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 36 states in the 6x6 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 6 x 6. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 S . . . . .
1 . . . . . .
2 X . . M M .
3 . X . . . .
4 . X G . . .
5 . . X . . .

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through


COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column

ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN→(1,0), LEFT→(0,0)
From (0,1): UP→(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN→(1,1), LEFT→(0,0)
From (1,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN→(2,0), LEFT→(1,0)


TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(2, 4), (2, 3)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along the trajectory each timestep)
- Your current goal: (4, 2) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 36 states in the 6x6 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

You are an expert path planner specializing in policy repair. You need to repair an existing policy to improve its formal verification scores.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT RESULTS:
Current verification probabilities:
  PASS  goal1: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  [relevant to this goal]
  PASS  goal2: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)
  PASS  goal3: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)
  FAIL  seq_1_before_2: 0.7915 (threshold: 0.8)  [relevant to this goal]  <-- below threshold
  PASS  seq_2_before_3: 0.9838 (threshold: 0.8)  [relevant to this goal]
  FAIL  complete_sequence: 0.7835 (threshold: 0.8)  <-- below threshold
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg1: 0.9336 (threshold: 0.5)  [relevant to this goal]
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg2: 0.9998 (threshold: 0.5)
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg3: 0.7669 (threshold: 0.5)


The grid world is 6 x 6. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 S . . . G .
1 . F . . . .
2 X . . M M .
3 . X . . . .
4 . X F . . .
5 . . X . . .

Grid Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

YOUR PREVIOUS POLICY (visualized as arrows):
   0  1  2  3  4  5
0  →  →  →  →  G  ←
1  ↑ F←  →  →  →  ↑
2 X→  →  ↓  ←  →  →
3  ↓ X→  →  →  →  ↑
4  ↓ X↓ F→  →  →  ↑
5  →  ← X←  →  →  ↑

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)
- G = Current goal (destination)

Compare this policy to the grid layout above to identify where actions lead toward obstacles or away from the goal.


COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column

ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN→(1,0), LEFT→(0,0)
From (0,1): UP→(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN→(1,1), LEFT→(0,0)
From (1,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN→(2,0), LEFT→(1,0)


HINTS (possible issues):
- Sequence ordering (seq_1_before_2): 0.7915 < 0.8 - Goals may be visited in wrong order


TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(1, 1), (4, 2)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(2, 4), (2, 3)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along the patrol path)
- Your current goal: (0, 4) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 36 states in the 6x6 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

2 X→  ↑  ←  ←  →  ↑
3  ↓ X→  ↑  ←  ←  ↑

5  ↑  ← X←  →  ↑  ←

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)

From (1,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN→(2,0), LEFT→(1,0)


HINTS (possible issues):
No specific problems identified, but overall LTL score is below 1.0


TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(4, 2)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(2, 4), (2, 3)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along the patrol path)

You are an expert path planner specializing in policy repair. You need to repair an existing policy to improve its formal verification scores.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT RESULTS:
Current verification probabilities:
  PASS  goal1: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)
  PASS  goal2: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)
  PASS  goal3: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  [relevant to this goal]
  FAIL  seq_1_before_2: 0.7915 (threshold: 0.8)  <-- below threshold
  PASS  seq_2_before_3: 0.9838 (threshold: 0.8)
  FAIL  complete_sequence: 0.7835 (threshold: 0.8)  <-- below threshold
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg1: 0.9336 (threshold: 0.5)
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg2: 0.9998 (threshold: 0.5)
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg3: 0.7669 (threshold: 0.5)  [relevant to this goal]


The grid world is 6 x 6. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 S . . . . .
1 . . . . . .
2 X . . M M .
3 . X . . . .
4 . X G . . .
5 . . X . . .

Grid Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

YOUR PREVIOUS POLICY (visualized as arrows):
   0  1  2  3  4  5
0  →  →  →  →  →  ↓
1  →  →  →  →  →  ↓
2 X→  ↑  ↑  ↓  ↓  ↓
3  ↓ X←  →  ↓  →  ↓
4  ↓ X←  G  ←  ←  ←
5  →  → X←  ↑  ←  ↑

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)
- G = Current goal (destination)

Compare this policy to the grid layout above to identify where actions lead toward obstacles or away from the goal.


COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column

ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN→(1,0), LEFT→(0,0)
From (0,1): UP→(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN→(1,1), LEFT→(0,0)
From (1,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN→(2,0), LEFT→(1,0)


HINTS (possible issues):
No specific problems identified, but overall LTL score is below 1.0


TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(2, 4), (2, 3)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along the patrol path)
- Your current goal: (4, 2) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 36 states in the 6x6 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

You are an expert path planner specializing in policy repair. You need to repair an existing policy to improve its formal verification scores.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT RESULTS:
Current verification probabilities:
  PASS  goal1: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  [relevant to this goal]
  PASS  goal2: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)
  PASS  goal3: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)
  FAIL  seq_1_before_2: 0.7915 (threshold: 0.8)  [relevant to this goal]  <-- below threshold
  PASS  seq_2_before_3: 0.9838 (threshold: 0.8)  [relevant to this goal]
  FAIL  complete_sequence: 0.7835 (threshold: 0.8)  <-- below threshold
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg1: 0.9336 (threshold: 0.5)  [relevant to this goal]
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg2: 0.9998 (threshold: 0.5)
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg3: 0.7669 (threshold: 0.5)


The grid world is 6 x 6. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 S . . . G .
1 . F . . . .
2 X . . M M .
3 . X . . . .
4 . X F . . .
5 . . X . . .

Grid Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

YOUR PREVIOUS POLICY (visualized as arrows):
   0  1  2  3  4  5
0  →  →  →  →  G  ←
1  ↑ F←  →  →  →  ↑
2 X→  →  ↓  ←  →  →
3  ↓ X→  →  →  →  ↑
4  ↓ X↓ F→  →  →  ↑
5  →  ← X←  →  →  ↑

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)
- G = Current goal (destination)

Compare this policy to the grid layout above to identify where actions lead toward obstacles or away from the goal.


COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column

ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN→(1,0), LEFT→(0,0)
From (0,1): UP→(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN→(1,1), LEFT→(0,0)
From (1,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN→(2,0), LEFT→(1,0)


HINTS (possible issues):
- Sequence ordering (seq_1_before_2): 0.7915 < 0.8 - Goals may be visited in wrong order


TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(1, 1), (4, 2)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(2, 4), (2, 3)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along the patrol path)
- Your current goal: (0, 4) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 36 states in the 6x6 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.

2 X→  ↑  ←  ←  →  ↑
3  ↓ X→  ↑  ←  ←  ↑
4  ↑ X← F↑  →  ↑  ↑
5  ↑  ← X←  →  ↑  ←

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)

From (1,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN→(2,0), LEFT→(1,0)


HINTS (possible issues):
No specific problems identified, but overall LTL score is below 1.0


TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(4, 2)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(2, 4), (2, 3)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along the patrol path)

You are an expert path planner specializing in policy repair. You need to repair an existing policy to improve its formal verification scores.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

PREVIOUS ATTEMPT RESULTS:
Current verification probabilities:
  PASS  goal1: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)
  PASS  goal2: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)
  PASS  goal3: 1.0000 (threshold: 0.8)  [relevant to this goal]
  FAIL  seq_1_before_2: 0.7915 (threshold: 0.8)  <-- below threshold
  PASS  seq_2_before_3: 0.9838 (threshold: 0.8)
  FAIL  complete_sequence: 0.7835 (threshold: 0.8)  <-- below threshold
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg1: 0.9336 (threshold: 0.5)
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg2: 0.9998 (threshold: 0.5)
  PASS  avoid_moving_seg3: 0.7669 (threshold: 0.5)  [relevant to this goal]


The grid world is 6 x 6. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 S . . . . .
1 . . . . . .
2 X . . M M .
3 . X . . . .
4 . X G . . .
5 . . X . . .

Grid Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

YOUR PREVIOUS POLICY (visualized as arrows):
   0  1  2  3  4  5
0  →  →  →  →  →  ↓
1  →  →  →  →  →  ↓
2 X→  ↑  ↑  ↓  ↓  ↓
3  ↓ X←  →  ↓  →  ↓
4  ↓ X←  G  ←  ←  ←
5  →  → X←  ↑  ←  ↑

Policy Legend:
- ↑ = UP (action 0), → = RIGHT (action 1), ↓ = DOWN (action 2), ← = LEFT (action 3)
- X↓ = Static obstacle with escape action (e.g., X↓ means obstacle, escape by going DOWN)
- F→ = Future goal with escape action (e.g., F→ means future goal, escape by going RIGHT)
- G = Current goal (destination)

Compare this policy to the grid layout above to identify where actions lead toward obstacles or away from the goal.


COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column

ACTION EXAMPLES:
From (0,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(0,1), DOWN→(1,0), LEFT→(0,0)
From (0,1): UP→(0,1), RIGHT→(0,2), DOWN→(1,1), LEFT→(0,0)
From (1,0): UP→(0,0), RIGHT→(1,1), DOWN→(2,0), LEFT→(1,0)


HINTS (possible issues):
No specific problems identified, but overall LTL score is below 1.0


TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(2, 0), (3, 1), (4, 1), (5, 2)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(2, 4), (2, 3)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along the patrol path)
- Your current goal: (4, 2) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 36 states in the 6x6 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)

Now provide the best action (0-3) for each state.
