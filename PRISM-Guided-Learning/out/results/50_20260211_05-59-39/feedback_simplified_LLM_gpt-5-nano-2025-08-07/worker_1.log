You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 4 x 4. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3
0 S F . .
1 . G . .
2 . . . M
3 X F M M

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(3, 0)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [(3, 1), (0, 1)] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (1, 1) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.



CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 16 states in the 4x4 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)


=== EXAMPLE 1 ===
Grid (6x6):
  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 S . . . . F
1 . . . . . X
2 . X . F G .
3 M M . . . .
4 M M . . X .
5 . . X . . .

Goal: (2,4)
Static obstacles: [(1,5), (2,1), (4,4), (5,2)]
Future goals: [(0,5), (2,3)]
Moving obstacles: [(3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1)]
Stochastic: 70% forward, 15% slip-left, 15% slip-right

Reasoning:

1. SAFE APPROACH TO GOAL
Check each neighbor of (2,4) for slip safety:
- From (1,4) via DOWN: slip-right lands on (1,5) X — 15% collision risk.
- From (2,3) via RIGHT: (2,3) is F — cannot use as approach cell.
- From (2,5) via LEFT: slip-left lands on (1,5) X — 15% collision risk.
- From (3,4) via UP: slips land on (3,3) and (3,5), both clear — SAFE.
Best approach: (3,4) -> UP.

2. MAIN CORRIDOR
Work backward from (3,4):
- Row 3 moving RIGHT from col 2-4 is clean: (3,2)->RIGHT, (3,3)->RIGHT, (3,4)->UP.
  Slip risk at (3,3): 15% up into (2,3) F — acceptable, only alternative is worse.
- Feed into row 3 via column 2 going DOWN: (0,2)->DOWN, (1,2)->DOWN, (2,2)->DOWN.
  Squeeze at (2,2)->DOWN: 15% slips hit (2,1) X and (2,3) F — unavoidable bottleneck.

3. PROBLEM ZONES
- (2,0) is squeezed: DOWN->(3,0) M, RIGHT->(2,1) X. Only safe exit is UP.
- Cells (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) are M — assign escape actions to exit M zone.
- (5,4) cannot go UP (70% into (4,4) X) — go LEFT instead, only 15% slip-up risk.

4. OVERALL FLOW
- Top rows: move RIGHT along row 0-1 to reach column 2, then DOWN.
- Bottom rows: move UP toward row 3 highway, then RIGHT to (3,4), then UP to goal.
- Right side: (2,5)->LEFT and (3,5)->LEFT feed directly toward goal area.

Policy:
(0,0)=1  (0,1)=1  (0,2)=2  (0,3)=2  (0,4)=2  (0,5)=3
(1,0)=1  (1,1)=1  (1,2)=2  (1,3)=1  (1,4)=2  (1,5)=3
(2,0)=0  (2,1)=0  (2,2)=2  (2,3)=1  (2,4)=0  (2,5)=3
(3,0)=0  (3,1)=1  (3,2)=1  (3,3)=1  (3,4)=0  (3,5)=3
(4,0)=2  (4,1)=1  (4,2)=0  (4,3)=0  (4,4)=0  (4,5)=0
(5,0)=1  (5,1)=0  (5,2)=0  (5,3)=0  (5,4)=3  (5,5)=0

=== EXAMPLE 2 ===
Grid (6x6):
  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 S . . . G .
1 . F . . . .
2 X . . M M .
3 . X . . . .
4 . X F . . .
5 . . X . . .

Goal: (0,4)
Static obstacles: [(2,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,2)]
Future goals: [(1,1), (4,2)]
Moving obstacles: [(2,3), (2,4)]
Stochastic: 70% forward, 15% slip-left, 15% slip-right

Reasoning:

1. SAFE APPROACH TO GOAL
Check each neighbor of (0,4) for slip safety:
- From (0,3) via RIGHT: slips hit wall-bounce and (1,3), both clear — SAFE.
- From (1,4) via UP: slips hit (1,3) and (1,5), both clear — SAFE.
- From (0,5) via LEFT: slips hit wall-bounce and (1,5), both clear — SAFE.
Multiple safe approaches — good. Policy can funnel from multiple directions.

2. MAIN CORRIDORS
- Row 0 express: (0,0)->RIGHT, (0,1)->RIGHT, (0,2)->RIGHT, (0,3)->RIGHT to goal.
  All slips are wall-bounces (up) or row-1 cells. Only risk: (0,1)->RIGHT has 15% slip into (1,1) F.
- Eastern column: cells on right side go UP through rows to reach row 0-1.
- Central: avoid M cells at (2,3) and (2,4). Route around via (3,3)->RIGHT, (3,4)->RIGHT,
  (3,5)->UP instead of going directly UP through M row.

3. PROBLEM ZONES
- TRAPPED POCKET: (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1) are walled in by X at (2,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,2).
  No stochastically reliable exit. Assign best-effort actions but these cells effectively cannot reach goal.
- (2,1) is squeezed: UP->(1,1) F, LEFT->(2,0) X, DOWN->(3,1) X. Only option is RIGHT (70% safe).
  Slips hit F and X at 15% each — unavoidable.
- Cells near M row: (3,3) and (3,4) use RIGHT instead of UP to avoid 70% chance of entering M.

4. OVERALL FLOW
- Top half: row-0 express lane going RIGHT, row-1 feeds UP into row 0.
- Bottom-right: go UP through columns 3-5, routing around M cells.
- Bottom-left: trapped pocket, minimal reachability.

Policy:
(0,0)=1  (0,1)=1  (0,2)=1  (0,3)=1  (0,4)=0  (0,5)=3
(1,0)=0  (1,1)=0  (1,2)=1  (1,3)=0  (1,4)=0  (1,5)=0
(2,0)=0  (2,1)=1  (2,2)=0  (2,3)=0  (2,4)=0  (2,5)=0
(3,0)=2  (3,1)=0  (3,2)=0  (3,3)=1  (3,4)=1  (3,5)=0
(4,0)=2  (4,1)=1  (4,2)=0  (4,3)=0  (4,4)=0  (4,5)=0
(5,0)=0  (5,1)=3  (5,2)=1  (5,3)=0  (5,4)=0  (5,5)=0


INSTRUCTIONS:
Before producing your policy, reason through the following:
1. Which neighbor of the goal has the safest slip profile?
2. What corridor feeds that approach cell?
3. Which cells are squeezed between obstacles (high unavoidable risk)?
4. Are any cells trapped / unreachable?

Now provide the best action for all states.

You are an expert path planner working on formulating paths that meet formal requirements.

Your task is to create a best-action policy for a grid world — choose one action per cell that guides the agent from any position to the goal while avoiding static obstacles, future goals, and moving obstacles.

The grid world is 4 x 4. Here is the visual layout:

  0 1 2 3
0 S G . .
1 . . . .
2 . . . M
3 X . M M

Legend:
- 'S' = Start position (0,0) - the initial state
- 'G' = Current goal position you must reach
- 'X' = Static obstacle (CANNOT enter - you will bounce back)
- 'F' = Future goal (treat as obstacle for now - avoid it)
- 'M' = Moving obstacle patrol path (avoid if possible)
- '.' = Empty cell you can move through

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- Position format: (row, col) where row is Y-axis, col is X-axis
- (0,0) is in the TOP-LEFT corner
- Row increases DOWNWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)
- Column increases RIGHTWARD (0 → 1 → 2...)

ACTIONS - pick ONE best action per state:
- 0 = UP: Move to (row-1, col) - DECREASES row
- 1 = RIGHT: Move to (row, col+1) - INCREASES column
- 2 = DOWN: Move to (row+1, col) - INCREASES row
- 3 = LEFT: Move to (row, col-1) - DECREASES column
TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(3, 0)] (marked as 'X')
- Future goals to avoid: [] (marked as 'F')
- Moving obstacles: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)] (marked as 'M', which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (0, 1) (marked as 'G')

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction

Example: If you choose DOWN, there's a 70% chance of going DOWN, 15% chance of going LEFT, and 15% chance of going RIGHT.

This means your paths should be ROBUST - avoid routes that pass adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.



CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST provide the best action for ALL 16 states in the 4x4 grid
2. Never plan a path through obstacles (X) or future goals (F)
2a. Avoid moving obstacles (M) along their patrol paths if possible
3. The best action should create a path from ANY position to the goal
4. If a cell is an obstacle (X, M) or future goal (F), provide an escape action (how to exit if accidentally there due to stochastic slip)


=== EXAMPLE 1 ===
Grid (6x6):
  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 S . . . . F
1 . . . . . X
2 . X . F G .
3 M M . . . .
4 M M . . X .
5 . . X . . .

Goal: (2,4)
Static obstacles: [(1,5), (2,1), (4,4), (5,2)]
Future goals: [(0,5), (2,3)]
Moving obstacles: [(3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1)]
Stochastic: 70% forward, 15% slip-left, 15% slip-right

Reasoning:

1. SAFE APPROACH TO GOAL
Check each neighbor of (2,4) for slip safety:
- From (1,4) via DOWN: slip-right lands on (1,5) X — 15% collision risk.
- From (2,3) via RIGHT: (2,3) is F — cannot use as approach cell.
- From (2,5) via LEFT: slip-left lands on (1,5) X — 15% collision risk.
- From (3,4) via UP: slips land on (3,3) and (3,5), both clear — SAFE.
Best approach: (3,4) -> UP.

2. MAIN CORRIDOR
Work backward from (3,4):
- Row 3 moving RIGHT from col 2-4 is clean: (3,2)->RIGHT, (3,3)->RIGHT, (3,4)->UP.
  Slip risk at (3,3): 15% up into (2,3) F — acceptable, only alternative is worse.
- Feed into row 3 via column 2 going DOWN: (0,2)->DOWN, (1,2)->DOWN, (2,2)->DOWN.
  Squeeze at (2,2)->DOWN: 15% slips hit (2,1) X and (2,3) F — unavoidable bottleneck.

3. PROBLEM ZONES
- (2,0) is squeezed: DOWN->(3,0) M, RIGHT->(2,1) X. Only safe exit is UP.
- Cells (3,0), (3,1), (4,0), (4,1) are M — assign escape actions to exit M zone.
- (5,4) cannot go UP (70% into (4,4) X) — go LEFT instead, only 15% slip-up risk.

4. OVERALL FLOW
- Top rows: move RIGHT along row 0-1 to reach column 2, then DOWN.
- Bottom rows: move UP toward row 3 highway, then RIGHT to (3,4), then UP to goal.
- Right side: (2,5)->LEFT and (3,5)->LEFT feed directly toward goal area.

Policy:
(0,0)=1  (0,1)=1  (0,2)=2  (0,3)=2  (0,4)=2  (0,5)=3
(1,0)=1  (1,1)=1  (1,2)=2  (1,3)=1  (1,4)=2  (1,5)=3
(2,0)=0  (2,1)=0  (2,2)=2  (2,3)=1  (2,4)=0  (2,5)=3
(3,0)=0  (3,1)=1  (3,2)=1  (3,3)=1  (3,4)=0  (3,5)=3
(4,0)=2  (4,1)=1  (4,2)=0  (4,3)=0  (4,4)=0  (4,5)=0
(5,0)=1  (5,1)=0  (5,2)=0  (5,3)=0  (5,4)=3  (5,5)=0

=== EXAMPLE 2 ===
Grid (6x6):
  0 1 2 3 4 5
0 S . . . G .
1 . F . . . .
2 X . . M M .
3 . X . . . .
4 . X F . . .
5 . . X . . .

Goal: (0,4)
Static obstacles: [(2,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,2)]
Future goals: [(1,1), (4,2)]
Moving obstacles: [(2,3), (2,4)]
Stochastic: 70% forward, 15% slip-left, 15% slip-right

Reasoning:

1. SAFE APPROACH TO GOAL
Check each neighbor of (0,4) for slip safety:
- From (0,3) via RIGHT: slips hit wall-bounce and (1,3), both clear — SAFE.
- From (1,4) via UP: slips hit (1,3) and (1,5), both clear — SAFE.
- From (0,5) via LEFT: slips hit wall-bounce and (1,5), both clear — SAFE.
Multiple safe approaches — good. Policy can funnel from multiple directions.

2. MAIN CORRIDORS
- Row 0 express: (0,0)->RIGHT, (0,1)->RIGHT, (0,2)->RIGHT, (0,3)->RIGHT to goal.
  All slips are wall-bounces (up) or row-1 cells. Only risk: (0,1)->RIGHT has 15% slip into (1,1) F.
- Eastern column: cells on right side go UP through rows to reach row 0-1.
- Central: avoid M cells at (2,3) and (2,4). Route around via (3,3)->RIGHT, (3,4)->RIGHT,
  (3,5)->UP instead of going directly UP through M row.

3. PROBLEM ZONES
- TRAPPED POCKET: (3,0), (4,0), (5,0), (5,1) are walled in by X at (2,0), (3,1), (4,1), (5,2).
  No stochastically reliable exit. Assign best-effort actions but these cells effectively cannot reach goal.
- (2,1) is squeezed: UP->(1,1) F, LEFT->(2,0) X, DOWN->(3,1) X. Only option is RIGHT (70% safe).
  Slips hit F and X at 15% each — unavoidable.
- Cells near M row: (3,3) and (3,4) use RIGHT instead of UP to avoid 70% chance of entering M.

4. OVERALL FLOW
- Top half: row-0 express lane going RIGHT, row-1 feeds UP into row 0.
- Bottom-right: go UP through columns 3-5, routing around M cells.
- Bottom-left: trapped pocket, minimal reachability.

Policy:
(0,0)=1  (0,1)=1  (0,2)=1  (0,3)=1  (0,4)=0  (0,5)=3
(1,0)=0  (1,1)=0  (1,2)=1  (1,3)=0  (1,4)=0  (1,5)=0
(2,0)=0  (2,1)=1  (2,2)=0  (2,3)=0  (2,4)=0  (2,5)=0
(3,0)=2  (3,1)=0  (3,2)=0  (3,3)=1  (3,4)=1  (3,5)=0
(4,0)=2  (4,1)=1  (4,2)=0  (4,3)=0  (4,4)=0  (4,5)=0
(5,0)=0  (5,1)=3  (5,2)=1  (5,3)=0  (5,4)=0  (5,5)=0


INSTRUCTIONS:
Before producing your policy, reason through the following:
1. Which neighbor of the goal has the safest slip profile?
2. What corridor feeds that approach cell?
3. Which cells are squeezed between obstacles (high unavoidable risk)?
4. Are any cells trapped / unreachable?

Now provide the best action for all states.

The grid world is 4x4. Here is the visual layout:

2 . . . M

Legend: S=Start(0,0), G=Current goal, X=Static obstacle, F=Future goal, M=Moving obstacle, .=Empty

3 X↑ F↑ M↑ M↑

Policy Legend: ↑=UP(0), →=RIGHT(1), ↓=DOWN(2), ←=LEFT(3), X↓=obstacle+escape, M→=moving+action, F→=future+escape, G=goal

Raw policy:

(2, 1)=0
(2, 2)=0
(2, 3)=3
(3, 0)=0
(3, 1)=0
(3, 2)=0
(3, 3)=0

Compare this policy to the grid layout above to identify where actions lead toward obstacles or away from the goal.

COORDINATE SYSTEM:
- (row, col), (0,0) top-left, row increases DOWN, col increases RIGHT

ACTIONS: 0=UP(row-1), 1=RIGHT(col+1), 2=DOWN(row+1), 3=LEFT(col-1)

Action examples:
- At (2,3), action 1 (RIGHT) moves to (2,4)
- At (0,1), action 0 (UP) bounces off wall, stays at (0,1)
- At (3,3), action 2 (DOWN) on a 4x4 grid bounces off wall, stays at (3,3)

TASK DETAILS:
- Static obstacles: [(3, 0)] (marked X)
- Future goals to avoid: [(3, 1), (0, 1)] (marked F)
- Moving obstacles: [(3, 2), (3, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)] (marked M, which could be anywhere along their patrol path)
- Your current goal: (1, 1) (marked G)

STOCHASTIC EXECUTION:
When you choose an action, the agent executes it with uncertainty:
- 70% probability: Moves in the intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° LEFT of intended direction
- 15% probability: Slips 90° RIGHT of intended direction
This means paths should be ROBUST — avoid routes adjacent to obstacles since slips could cause collisions.

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Provide the best action for ALL 16 states in the 4x4 grid
2. Never plan through obstacles (X) or future goals (F); avoid moving obstacles (M)
3. For obstacle/future-goal cells, provide an escape action
4. Focus on fixing the failing requirements shown above while preserving what works

Now provide the corrected best action for all states.
